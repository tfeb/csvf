# `csvf`
This is a simple field extractor for CSV files, written in Python 2 (as it's quite old).

Until recently this existed only as a gist, but since it's going to be souped up somewhat it is now a proper repo.

## What it can do
It works as a filter, so you want to use it as

```
$ csvf ... < file.csv
```

The simplest usage is just to give it a bunch of field numbers, with the first field being `1`.  So


```
$ csvf 1 3 < file.csv
```

will print the first and third field from `file.csv`.  If you give it no field numbers it will print the entire row.

The output is *not* CSV!  Instead the output format is controlled by three options.

- `-s sep` controls the separator between fields, which is defaultly a space character.
- `-m mri` controls what is printed for a missing field â€“ usually if you've tried to print a field beyond the end of the row.  By default it is `-`.
- `-f fmt` controls how each field is printed.  This is a Python format string.  By default it is `"{0}"` which means there are double quotes around each field: you can change this by, for instance `csvf -f '{0}' ...` which will not print any quotes at all.
- `-w` causes it to write CSV using Python's support for that.  In that case only the missing record indicator matters: everything else is dealt with by the CSV writer.
- `-d dialect` sets the CSV dialect for both input & output.  See the Python `csv` module documentation for which dialects exist, but the default is usually fine.

In addition you can *edit* the output in various ways.

- `-c f v` will force field `f` to be the string `v`.
- `-e f p r` will, for field `f`, do a regular expression replacement of `p` by `r`.  This is the hairiest editing option.
- `-s f s r` will, for field `f`, replace it by `r` if it is the string `s`.  This is a simpler editing option.

All of these options can be specified as many times as you like.  The operations take place in that order: fields are set to constants, then regular expressions are replaced, then fixed strings are replaced.  There is only one pass, so you can't do clever trickery like replacing regular expressions with patterns that other regular expressions will match.  The operations only work on non-missing fields: you can't extend rows by forcing fields to be a constant.

## Examples
Given this CSV file, `foo.csv`:

```
fish,bat,bone
fish,dog,spot
bird,cake,hoover
```

Then

```
$ csvf <foo.csv
"fish" "bat" "bone"
"fish" "dog" "spot"
"bird" "cake" "hoover"
$ csvf -s: -f '{0}' <foo.csv
fish:bat:bone
fish:dog:spot
bird:cake:hoover
$ csvf -s: -f '{0}' -r 1 fish bat <foo.csv
bat:bat:bone
bat:dog:spot
bird:cake:hoover
$ csvf -s: -f '{0}' -e 2 '^ba' bi <foo.csv
fish:bit:bone
fish:dog:spot
bird:cake:hoover
$ csvf -w 1 2 <foo.csv
fish,bat
fish,dog
bird,cake
```

## Notes
It makes no attempt to deal with fields that contain the output field separator or the no-field indicator.  If you want to extract fields which contain these the separator, then the way to do it is to extract them one at a time, so you know there is one field per line.  I don't think there's any way at all to detect missing fields reliably as it stands.

This is not particularly well-tested code.  Error handling is rudimentary.

It should work in Python 2.7.  If you want it to work on 2.6 let me know (but it may be hard to backport now).
